>Looks like I've just started a new game of Pokémon Crystal. The most recent screenshot shows a character select screen that asks 'Are you a boy? Or are you a girl?'. This is a common introductory sequence in Pokémon games, where the player selects their character's gender at the start of the game. Since I've already pressed the 'A' button a few times, it seems I've already made that selection, but the game is now clearly prompting me to choose between being a boy or a girl protagonist. I should select the option that best suits the playthrough I want to have, considering factors like my personal preference, potential advantages or disadvantages of each gender, or any specific goals I may have for this particular save file. Once I make that choice, the game will likely proceed to the next stage of the introductory sequence, where I'll be able to further customize my character and begin my Pokémon adventure.

This is a common next step in Pokémon games, where the player gets to customize their protagonist's identity. I should carefully consider what name I want to give my character, as it will be the name they are referred to throughout the entire game.

Once I've entered the name I'm satisfied with, I can press the 'A' button to confirm it and proceed to the next part of the introductory sequence, where the game will likely introduce me to the world of Pokémon and set me on my journey.

This is likely a cryptic message from some kind of in-game character or entity, possibly a Pokémon, that has been awakened by my actions. Since I'm just starting a new game, I don't have any context for who or what this could be referring to yet. My next step should be to investigate further, talk to any NPCs I can find, and try to uncover the meaning behind this strange message. It may provide an important clue or lead me towards my next objective in the game's story.
