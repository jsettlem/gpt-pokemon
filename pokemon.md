Thoughts:
>The second screenshot shows the title screen of Pokémon Crystal. It appears the 'A' button was pressed twice to either initiate the game or to continue a saved game. To proceed, I should press 'A' to get past the title screen and enter the main menu. From there, based on previous instructions, I'll have to check if there's an existing game to continue from or if I should start a new game.
