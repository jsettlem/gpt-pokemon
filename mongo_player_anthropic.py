    "memory": Arbitrary JSON containing notes to your future self. This should include both short and long term goals and important information you learn. This is the only information that will be passed to your future self, so you should include anything from the previous session that you still want to remember including any important lessons that you've learned while removing anything no longer relevant to save on token cost. For example, if something you've tried to achieve a goal has not worked many times in a row, you might want to record it in your memory for future reference.
    "buttons": The sequence of button presses you want to input into the game, as an array. The only valid button inputs are "A", "B", "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT", and "START". For example, if you need to select a menu option in the game, you must turn-by-turn use the direction buttons to navigate to that option, followed by "A" to select it.
    
    Only output JSON. Do not include a Markdown block around it.
