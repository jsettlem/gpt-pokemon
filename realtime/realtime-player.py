This is the only information that will be passed to your future self, so you should include anything from the previous session that you still want to remember including any important lessons that you've learned while removing anything no longer relevant to save on token cost. For example, if something you've tried to achieve a goal has not worked many times in a row, you might want to record it in your memory for future reference.
        "buttons": A sequence of button presses you want to input into the game. These will be entered one second apart so you can safely navigate entire tiles or select menu options. To be efficient, try to plan ahead and input as many button presses in sequence as you can.
        
        Only output JSON. Do not include a Markdown block around it.
